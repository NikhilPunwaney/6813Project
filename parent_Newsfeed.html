<h2> Arts and Crafts Day</h2>
<p> Today the students did arts and crafts for senior citizens at a local nursing home. We were inspired to do this after the school's choir visted the nursing home and saw how happy the senior citizens were to be able to interact with children. So today we spent about an hour making cards and pretty posters that I will drop off at the nursing home later this week. </p>

<h2> The Civil War</h2>
<p> Today the students learned about the American Civil War. We read children's books about the war and saw some maps that showed exactly where the different battles occurred. </p>

<h2> Plymouth Plantation Field Trip</h2>
<p> This week we visited Plymouth Plantation as part of our study of the pilgrims. We have been learning about the pilgrims for the past weeks and this field trip was a great way for the students to get a better idea of their way of life. The kids had a great time and really loved interacting with the actors and actresses at Plymouth Plantation. </p>
